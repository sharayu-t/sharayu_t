### I'm on a journey to learn, explore, and get mesmerized by what data can do!

## About Me
I was introduced to data during my undergraduate studies in Mechanical Engineering. My career trajectory changed when I took Data Analytics as one of my elective subject, worked on a few projects and secured two internships in the field of Data Science in my final semester. Later, I completed a 1 year Post Graduate Diploma in Data Science and AI along with working full time as a Tableau Developer at Intelimek Systems. Currently, I am pursuing Master's in Data Analytics at Northeastern Univeristy. 

On my GitHub profile, I share some of my projects that I've worked on personally and as a part of my academics that include skills of Data Analysis, Data Management, Data Visualization and Machine Learning.
